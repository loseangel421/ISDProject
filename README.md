A (fictitious) Glasgow-based engineering company is considering constructing a renewable energy system on the island of Great Cumbrae. 
The aim would be to generate sufficient electricity to fully meet the island's needs. The board of the company has decided to set up a
multi-disciplinary team (your team) to consider the technical and commercial viability of the project, as well as its
overall environmental and human impact.
