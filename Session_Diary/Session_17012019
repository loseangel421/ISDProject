Topic of the day : Activities checkpoint/concept developing

Today, 17/01/2019 we discussed about several topics divided in the sections that are going to be shown below. 

1. Progress control

QUALITIY MANAGER
   1. Presentation of all the key factor that we have to take into account:
       Response of the projecto to changing demand
       How much energy we need to produce?
       Is it the project easy to maintain in the time?
       How many environmentally impact do we stimate?
       Is the project going to be built on the coast or in the island.
       Which physical phenomenom are we going to use for electricity? wind, sun, tides, geothermal.
    2. Document about low solar irradiance in the island

CONSTRUCTION MANAGER
    1. Project Phases: 
        Initial phase: Documents and contracts.
        Construction phase: Delivery and equipment.
        (Delivery) phase: Maintenance and operation.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGER
    1. Which energy supply to use: geothermal is the lowest impact energy solution. Secondly, solar and the last, wind.

ELECTRICAL MANAGER
    1. Need to know how much power is going to be produced and then all the materials will be calculated.

PROJECT MANAGER
    1. Task distribution for everyone.
    2. Next appointment milestones.
    
HEALTH AND SAFETY MANAGER
    1. Found the minimal safety conditions for workers.
    2. Contracts for workers
