session)

Today, 17/01/2019 we discussed about several topics divided in the sections that are going to be shown below. 

1. Progress control

Pre evaluation

  Y  1. Energy required estimation: 
  Y  2. Come up with the technology required for the power estimation:
  Y  3. Individual working branch for each member in github:
  Y  4. Time sheet:
  Y  5. Task Sheet:
  Y  6. Create basic structure of the project template:

QUALITIY MANAGER
   1. The Wind Power is the most efficient energy supply. 

CONSTRUCTION MANAGER
    1. Once we have the number of turbines, he can start the construction plan.


ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGER
    1. Among all the energy supplies, the wind energy is the safest and more reliable. However, 
    we need to storage energy, so we will use a physical storage.

ELECTRICAL MANAGER
    1. 
    
PROJECT MANAGER
    1. Task distribution for everyone.
    2. Tidal energy is discarded according to the official map of tides. In the island if Great Cumbrae 
    the tidal energy or amount of tidal movement is not enough for producing the neccesary amount of energy
    for our system.
    
HEALTH AND SAFETY MANAGER
    1. Use of the Software HOMER, but we need: electricity load and energy used, as well as number of clouds, 
    sunny days, and other peculiarities.
    
    
PROJECT ACCOUNTANT
    1. Cost of wind power.
    2. Construction time.
    3. Cost of the equipment -> 20 y.
    4. Maintenance.
    5. Cost, interest rate very high.
    6. Wind Power: More feasible, 2.5- 2.8 million pounds for 3 turbines.

PROJECT PLANNER
    1. Preparation of Project Gantt Chartt
    2. Homer software download and preparation
    3. Time Schedule
    4. Organisation of meetings.

NEXT SESSION MILESTONES & TASK DISTRIBUTION
In the next session the next list should be checked for the weekly evaluation. The evaluation should be filled every week.

    1. Frank(Quality Manager)- Develop quality plan detailing standards for project implementation. Also include planning permissions & 
    licenses.
    2. Rafay (Heatlh & Safety Manager), Gabri (Project Planner) and Damian (Project Manager)- Develop simulation model for HOMER energy
    analytical tool.
    3. Rajat (Connstruction Manager)- Develop questionaire to be given to local council during visit. Must include project methodology to
    gauge project acceptability.
    4. Other teammates begin developing their own sections for the interim/feasibility report.

NEXT MEETING : ????????????THURSDAY 24 AT 5-7 p.m. AT THE LIBRARY
